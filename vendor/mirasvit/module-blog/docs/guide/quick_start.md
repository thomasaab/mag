# Quick Start

Our Blog MX extension is a simple yet powerful extension, and its features work directly our-of-box. But there's more to tune-up for maximum performance.

1. Start with creation of [**Category**](/guide/categories) structure. It allows you to arrange your themes in sensical tree.

2. Write a number of [**Blog posts**](/guide/posts), and add there featured images, tags and even products to make customers shop them directly from article.

3. Tune up your blog service with flexible [**Settings**](/guide/settings), added to **Configuration** section.

4. Use your creativity to make bright and attractive Blogs.

This should be a good beginning.
